# georgian winter olympiad in informatics 2021

## Includes:

statements for problems A B and C in georgian

solution for problem A and partial(26 points) solution for problem C in c++

## Short statements in english:

### A rotation

**input**: integer 2 < b <= 16 and 4 numbers in base-b

length of these numbers does not exceed 10000 digits

**output**: define rot(m) as moving ms first digit to the last position for example if m=650F, rot(m)=50F6

for each of the 4 numbers M output a minimum positive number N such that rot(N)-N=M

if such N does not exist output 0

### C sum of two numbers

**input**: integer 2 <= b <= 32 and two positive rational numbers in base-b

for example 002.322(22) or 0B.C(0)

**output**: sum of these 2 numbers in base-b in standard notation (without leading zeroes, the smallest possible period and so on)
